/*
 *   Solving the Poisson's equation discretized on the [0,1]x[0,1] domain
 *   using the finite difference method and a Jacobi's iterative solver.
 *
 *   Delta u = f(x,y)= 2*(x*x-x+y*y -y)
 *   u equal 0 on the boudaries
 *   The exact solution is u = x*y*(x-1)*(y-1)
 *
 *   The u value is :
 *    coef(1) = (0.5*hx*hx*hy*hy)/(hx*hx+hy*hy)
 *    coef(2) = 1./(hx*hx)
 *    coef(3) = 1./(hy*hy)
 *
 *    u(i,j)(n+1)= coef(1) * (  coef(2)*(u(i+1,j)+u(i-1,j)) &
 *               + coef(3)*(u(i,j+1)+u(i,j-1)) - f(i,j))
 *
 *   ntx and nty are the total number of interior points along x and y, respectivly.
 * 
 *   hx is the grid spacing along x and hy is the grid spacing along y.
 *    hx = 1./(ntx+1)
 *    hy = 1./(nty+1)
 *
 *   On each process, we need to:
 *   1) Split up the domain
 *   2) Find our 4 neighbors
 *   3) Exchange the interface points
 *   4) Calculate u
